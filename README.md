# Reaction-timer-using-ARM7

A reaction timer circuit is an electronic circuit designed to measure and display the time it takes for a person to react to a stimulus. This type of circuit is commonly used in games, psychology experiments, and cognitive testing to assess a person's reflexes and response time.

This circuit is made using ARM7  NPX model LPC2124 micro processor to check and count the reacton time in milli second of the user. 

### The project consists of 
- A proteus simulated circuit
- C code
- A generated HEX file to interface the simulated microprocessor with the C code

  **The project is done using Proteus and IAR Embedded Workbench**

## Uses of the project 
Reaction timer circuits are used in a range of applications, including:

- **Entertainment and games**: Reaction time games challenge players to respond quickly to stimuli, adding an element of fun and competition.
- **Psychological experiments**: Researchers use reaction timer circuits to study human reflexes, cognitive processing, and response times in various scenarios.
- **Sports training**: Athletes and coaches might use reaction timer circuits to help improve response times and coordination.
- **Educational tools**: Reaction timer circuits can be used as teaching aids to help students understand concepts related to timing, signal processing, and electronic circuits.
