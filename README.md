# Reaction-timer-using-ARM7

A reaction timer circuit is an electronic circuit designed to measure and display the time it takes for a person to react to a stimulus. This type of circuit is commonly used in games, psychology experiments, and cognitive testing to assess a person's reflexes and response time.

This circuit is made using ARM7  NPX model LPC2124 micro processor to check and count the reacton time in milli second of the user. 

### The project consists of 
- A proteus simulated circuit
- C code
- A generated HEX file to interface the simulated microprocessor with the C code

  <br/>
  **The project is done using Proteus and IAR Embedded Workbench**
